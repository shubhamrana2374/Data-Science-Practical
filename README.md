This repository is for ITEC657- Data science workshop work. Every week new notebook is added in the repository with the code and changes (if required) .Some files are also updated which will be used for analysis. This repository includes various scenario's which requires python knowledge  , analytical skills as well.

**Week 1** - Basic python includes string manipulation , control structures , functions , data and plotting.

**Week 2** - Markdown, lists, Dictionaries , Pandas and dataframes.

**Week 3** - Analysis on MPG data and adult data analysis.

**Week 4** - Week 4 excercise has seaborn plotting functions such as lmplot,  boxplot, violinplot, swarmplot, heatmap. Various other plots              also worked upon for instance distplot,countplot,factor plot,density plot and joint distribution plot.

**Week 5** - The goal of the workshop in week 5 is to work through a standard Data Science workflow: exploring data, building models,                    making predictions using Linear Regression, evaluating results . Here we split data into two datasets to train one dataset                  with the predictive model and test data on other dataset to check the efficiency of the model.

**Week 6** - In week 6, Logistic Regression method to do the prediction. Here , breast cancer data has been used from the [UCI repository]              (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
